# Perl's version strings do not support pre-release versions (alpha/development, beta, or release
# candidate) very well.  The best it does is an optional underscore between arbitrary digits in the
# final component (e.g., "v1.2.3_4").  The underscore doesn't behave as most developers expect; it
# is treated as if it never existed (e.g., "v1.2.3_4" becomes "v1.2.34") except:
#
#   * $v->is_alpha() will return true
#   * $v->is_strict() will return false
#   * $v->stringify() preserves the underscore (in its original position)
#
# Note that version::normal and version::numify lose information because the underscore is
# effectively removed.
#
# To work around Perl's limitations, Perl versions are translated to/from human-readable Semantic
# Versioning 2.0.0 <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html> version strings as follows:
#
#     Human-readable    Perl version    Notes
#     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#     1.2.3-alpha       v1.2.3.0_0      compares equal to Perl version v1.2.3 (unfortunately)
#     1.2.3-beta.N      v1.2.3.0_N      1 <= N < 900; compares equal to Perl v1.2.3.N
#     1.2.3-rc.N        v1.2.3.0_M      1 <= N < 99; M = N + 900; compares equal to Perl v1.2.3.M
#     1.2.3             v1.2.3.999      for releases; no underscore in Perl version string
#     1.2.3+r.N         v1.2.3.999.N    1 <= N < 1000; for re-releases, if necessary (rare)
#
# A hyphen-minus ('-', a.k.a. dash) is used to separate "alpha", "beta", and "rc" from the version
# numbers because that is what <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html> requires.  Tilde ('~') was
# considered instead of '-' because it has desirable semantics in the version comparison algorithms
# in Debian and RPM; see <https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/dpkg-dev/deb-version.7.en.html> and
# <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Versioning/#_handling_non_sorting_versions_with_tilde_dot_and_caret>
# However, tilde is not permitted in Git tags, so the human-readable version string would have to
# be transformed for release tags, and then transformed back by downstream package maintainers to
# reconstruct the original version string.  As long as downstream package maintainers have to
# transform the tag name anyway, the human-readable version string might as well have the same
# format as the tag name.  Version strings conforming to <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html> have
# this property.
#
# A period is required between "beta" or "rc" and its adjacent number(s) because
# <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html> says that parts containing non-number characters are
# compared lexicographically.  For example, '-beta9' unfortunately sorts after '-beta10' but
# '-beta.9' sorts before '-beta.10', as desired.  (Both the Debian and the RPM version comparison
# algorithms do not have this problem; they compare number parts numerically, not
# lexicographically, even if there is no period between the number and non-number characters.)
#
# A period is also required after the "r" for a re-release, but this is only for consistency with
# "beta" and "rc".  <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html> says that build metadata (the stuff after
# the plus ('+') character) does not affect ordering at all so the lack of a period would not
# affect ordering.
#
# The Perl version is declared first then converted to a human-readable form.  It would be nicer to
# declare a human-readable version string and convert that to a Perl version string, but various
# tools in the Perl ecosystem require the line of source code that defines the VERSION variable to
# be self-contained (because they grep the source code and evaluate only that one line).
#
# For consistency and to match user expectations, the release part of the version is always three
# components: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

# `%recap` holds details about recent updates (and attempts) that are needed to implement various
# service-specific and protocol-independent mechanisms such as `min-interval`.  This data is
# persisted in the cache file (`--cache`) so that it survives ddclient restarts.  This hash maps a
# hostname to a hashref with entries that map variable names to values.  Only entries for the
# host's "recap variables" -- those declared in the host's protocol's `recapvars` property -- are
# included.
#
# There are two classes of recap variables:
#   * "Status" variables: These track update success/failure, the IP address of the last successful
#     update, etc.  These do not hold configuration data; they are unrelated to any entries in
#     `%config`.
#   * "Configuration change detection" variables: These are used to force an update if the value in
#     the same-named entry in `%config` has changed since the previous update attempt.  The value
#     stored in `%config` is the desired setting; the value in `%recap` is the desired setting as
#     it was just before the previous update attempt.  Values are synchronized from `%config` to
#     `%recap` during each update attempt.
#
# A protocol's set of config change detection variables can be found in the protocol's
# `force_update_if_changed` property; all other recap variables are assumed to be status variables.
#
# A note about terminology: This was previously named `%cache`, but "cache" implies that the
# purpose is to reduce the cost or latency of data retrieval or computation, and that deletion only
# affects performance.  That is not the case here, so the variable was renamed.  "Recap" is meant
# to evoke the "previously on" clips that play before TV episodes, which are designed to give you
# just enough context to recall the state.  The recap is written to the cache file, so-named for
# historical reasons.  (Renaming "cache file" to "recap file" is more difficult due to
# compatibility concerns with the public `--cache` option.)

    #   * `examples`: Required coderef that takes `($self)` and returns a string showing
    #     configuration examples for using the protocol.
    #   * `cfgvars`: Optional hashref of configuration variable declarations.  If omitted or
    #     `undef`, `$cfgvars{'protocol-common-defaults'}` is used.
    #   * `recapvars`: Optional hashref of recap variable declarations.  If omitted or `undef`,
    #     `$recapvars{'common'}` is used.
    #   * `force_update`: Optional coderef that takes `($self, $h)` and returns truthy to force the
    #     given host to update.  Omitting or passing `undef` is equivalent to passing a subroutine
    #     that always returns falsy.

    #     any of the named values in `%config` have changed since the previous update attempt
    #     (successful or not), the host update is forced.  If omitted or `undef`, an empty array is

            #     because that method is not always called before an update is attempted.
            #   * The vars must be updated after the `force_update` method would be called so that
            #     `force_update` can check whether any settings have changed since the last time an
            #     update was attempted.
            #   * The vars are updated before the protocol's `update` method is called so that
            #     `update` sees consistent values between `%recap` and `%config`.  This reduces the
            #     impact of Hyrum's Law; if a protocol needs a variable to be updated after the

    #   - No whitespace is allowed around the '=' in opt=value.

    #     underscore, and hyphen-minus, and must start with a letter.
    #   - A value or hostname is terminated by unquoted whitespace
    #     (including newline) or an unquoted comma followed by
    #     optional whitespace.
    #   - Values (but not hosts, login, or password) may contain
    #     quoted parts:
    #       - A backslash that itself is not quoted by another
    #         backslash quotes the next character.
    #       - An unquoted single quote quotes the subsequent
    #         non-backslash, non-newline characters until the next
    #         single quote.
    #       - An unquoted double quote quotes the subsequent
    #         non-backslash, non-newline characters until the next
    #         double quote.
    #   - login and password must not contain whitespace.
    #   - login must not start or end with a comma.
    #   - password must not start with a comma.
    #   - If no host is specified (either via a 'host=' option or
    #     after the options), the options are stored in %{$2}.
    #     Otherwise, the options are combined with the global values
    #     accumulated thus far and stored in $1->{$host} for each

== CONFIGURING ${program}

The configuration file, ${program}.conf, can be used to define the
default behaviour and operation of ${program}.  The file consists of
sequences of global variable definitions and host definitions.

Global definitions look like:
  name=value [,name=value]*

For example:
  daemon=5m
  use=if, if=eth0
  proxy=proxy.myisp.com
  protocol=dyndns2

specifies that ${program} should operate as a daemon, checking the
eth0 interface for an IP address change every 5 minutes and use the
'dyndns2' protocol by default. The daemon interval can be specified
as seconds (600s), minutes (5m), hours (1h) or days (1d).

Host definitions look like:
  [name=value [,name=value]*]* a.host.domain [,b.host.domain] [login] [password]

For example:
  protocol=noip, \\
  login=your-username, password=your-password  myhost.noip.com
  login=your-username, password=your-password  myhost.noip.com,myhost2.noip.com

specifies two host definitions.

The first definition will use the noip protocol,
your-username and your-password to update the ip-address of
myhost.noip.com and my2ndhost.noip.com.

The second host definition will use the current default protocol
('dyndns2'), my-login and my-password to update the ip-address of
myhost.dyndns.org and my2ndhost.dyndns.org.

The order of this sequence is significant because the values of any
global variable definitions are bound to a host definition when the
host definition is encountered.

See the sample-${program}.conf file for further examples.

## DDNS providers
#  A DDNS provider consists of an example function, the update
#  function, and an optional force_update function.
#
#  The example function simply returns a string for the help message,
#  explaining how to configure the provider
#
#  The update function performs the actual record update.
#  It receives an array of hosts as its argument.
#
#  The force_update function allows a provider implementation to force
#  an update even if ddclient has itself determined no update is
#  necessary. The function shall return 1 if an update should be
#  performed, else 0.

DNS service offered by www.dyndns.org. The 'dyndns2' should be used to
update the www.dyndns.org service.  However, other services are also
using this protocol so support is still provided by ${program}.

Configuration variables applicable to the 'dyndns1' protocol are:

  server=fqdn.of.service       ## defaults to members.dyndns.org

  mx=any.host.domain           ## a host MX'ing for this host definition.
  wildcard=no|yes              ## add a DNS wildcard CNAME record that points to <host>
  login=service-login          ## login name and password  registered with the service
  password=service-password    ##
  fully.qualified.host         ## the host registered with the service.

Note that we only update the record, it must already exist in the DNSExit system
(A and/or AAAA records where applicable).

Configuration variables applicable to the 'dnsexit2' protocol are:

  server=fqdn.of.service       ## defaults to members.easydns.com
  backupmx=no|yes              ## indicates that EasyDNS should be the secondary MX
                               ## for this domain or host.
  mx=any.host.domain           ## a host MX'ing for this host or domain.
  wildcard=no|yes              ## add a DNS wildcard CNAME record that points to <host>
  login=service-login          ## login name and password  registered with the service

## nic_freedns_update
##
## API v1 documented at https://freedns.afraid.org/api/
##
## An update requires two steps. The first is to get a list of records from:
##   https://freedns.afraid.org/api/?action=getdyndns&v=2&sha=<sha1sum of login|password>
## The returned list looks like:
##
##   hostname1.example.com|1.2.3.4|http://example/update/url1
##   hostname1.example.com|dead::beef|http://example/update/url2
##   hostname2.example.com|5.6.7.8|http://example/update/url3
##   hostname2.example.com|9.10.11.12|http://example/update/url4
##   hostname3.example.com|cafe::f00d|http://example/update/url5
##   hostname4.example.com|NULL|http://example/update/url6
##
## The record's columns are separated by '|'. The first is the hostname, the second is the current
## address, and the third is the record-specific update URL. There can be multiple records for the
## same host, and they can even have the same address type. To update an IP address the record
## must already exist of the type we want to update... We will not change a record type from
## an IPv4 to IPv6 or viz versa.  Records may exist with a NULL address which we will allow to be
## updated with an IPv4 address, not an IPv6.
##
## The second step is to visit the appropriate record's update URL with
## ?address=<ipv4-or-ipv6-address> appended. "Updated" in the result means success, "fail" means
## failure.

Note: this module examines the wantipv4 & wantipv6 parameters
  and will set either or both V4 and/or V6 addresses as required

Note: this service automatically sets the IP address to that from which the
request comes, so the IP address detected by ddclient is only used to keep
track of when it needs updating.

Example ${program}.conf file entries:
  ## Single host update.

o 'nsupdate'

The 'nsupdate' protocol is used to submit Dynamic DNS Update requests as
defined in RFC2136 to a name server using the 'nsupdate' command line
utility part of ISC BIND.  Dynamic DNS updates allow resource records to
be added or removed from a zone configured for dynamic updates through
DNS requests protected using TSIG.  BIND ships with 'ddns-confgen', a
utility to generate sample configurations and instructions for both the
server and the client.  See nsupdate(1) and ddns-confgen(8) for details.

Configuration variables applicable to the 'nsupdate' protocol are:
  protocol=nsupdate
  server=ns1.example.com       ## name or IP address of the DNS server to send
                               ## the update requests to; usually master for
                               ## zone, but slaves should forward the request
  password=tsig.key            ## path and name of the symmetric HMAC key file
                               ## to use for TSIG signing of the request
                               ## (as generated by 'ddns-confgen -q' and
                               ## configured on server in 'grant' statement)
  zone=dyn.example.com         ## forward zone that is to be updated
  ttl=600                      ## time to live of the record;
                               ## defaults to 600 seconds
  tcp=off|on                   ## nsupdate uses UDP by default, and switches to
                               ## TCP if the update is too large to fit in a
                               ## UDP datagram; this setting forces TCP;

o 'inwx'

The 'inwx' protocol is designed for DynDNS accounts at INWX
<https://www.inwx.com/>.  It is similar to the 'dyndns2' protocol except IPv6
addresses are passed in a separate 'myipv6' URL parameter (rather than included
in the 'myip' parameter):

    https://dyndns.inwx.com/nic/update?myip=<ipaddr>&myipv6=<ip6addr>

The 'inwx' protocol was designed around INWX's behavior as of June 2024:
  - Omitting the IPv4 address (either no 'myip' URL parameter or '<ipaddr>' is
    the empty string) will cause INWX to silently set the IPv4 address (A
    record) to '127.0.0.1'. No error message is returned.
  - Omitting the IPv6 address (either no 'myipv6' URL parameter or '<ip6addr>'
    is the empty string) will cause INWX to delete the IPv6 address (AAAA
    record) if it exists.
  - INWX will automatically create an IPv6 AAAA record for your hostname if
    necessary.
  - 'dyndns.inwx.com' is not reachable via IPv6 (there is no AAAA record).
  - GET 'https://dyndns.inwx.com/nic/update' without further parameters will set
    the IPv4 A record to the public IP of the requesting host and delete the
    IPv6 AAAA record.
  - You can ask INWX support to manually convert a DynDNS account into an
    IPv6-only account.  No A record will be created in that case.

Configuration variables applicable to the 'inwx' protocol are:
  protocol=inwx                ##
  server=fqdn.of.service       ## defaults to dyndns.inwx.com
  script=/path/to/script       ## defaults to /nic/update
  login=service-login          ## login name and password registered with the service
  password=service-password    ##
  fully.qualified.host         ## the host registered with the service.

Example ${program}.conf file entries:
  ## single host update
  protocol=inwx                             \\
  login=my-inwx-DynDNS-account-username     \\

The 'yandex' protocol is used to by DNS service offered by Yandex.

Configuration variables applicable to the 'yandex' protocol are:
  protocol=yandex             ##
  server=fqdn.of.service       ## defaults to pddimp.yandex.ru
  login=dns.zone               ## Your zone name
  password=pdd-token           ## PDD token for authentication
  fully.qualified.host         ## the host registered with the service.

Example ${program}.conf file entries:
  ## single host update

o 'porkbun'

The 'porkbun' protocol is used for porkbun (https://porkbun.com/).
The API is documented here: https://porkbun.com/api/json/v3/documentation

Before setting up, it is necessary to create your API Key by referring to the following page.

https://kb.porkbun.com/article/190-getting-started-with-the-porkbun-api

Available configuration variables:
  * apikey (required): API Key of Porkbun API
  * secretapikey (required): Secret API Key of Porkbun API
  * root-domain: The root domain of the specified domain name.
  * on-root-domain=yes or no (default: no): Indicates whether the specified domain name (FQDN) is
    an unnamed record (Zone APEX) in a zone.
    It is useful to specify it as a local variable as shown in the example.
    This configuration value is deprecated, use root-domain instead!
  * server: API endpoint to use, defaults to api.porkbun.com
  * usev4, usev6 : These configuration variables can be specified as local variables to override
    the global settings. It is useful to finely control IPv4 or IPv6 as shown in the example.
  * use (deprecated) : This parameter is deprecated but can be overridden like the above parameters.

Limitations:
  * Multiple same name records (for round robin) are not supported.
    The same IP address is set for all, creating meaningless extra records.
  * If neither root-domain nor on-root-domain are specified, ${program} will split the given
    hostname into subdomain and domain on the first dot.
    For example:
      * sub.example.com -> Subdomain "sub", root domain "example.com"
      * sub.foo.example.com -> Subdomain "sub", root domain "foo.example.com"
    If both root-domain and on-root-domain are specified, root-domain takes precedence.

Example ${program}.conf file entry:
  protocol=porkbun
  apikey=APIKey
  secretapikey=SecretAPIKey
  root-domain=example.com
  example.com,host.example.com,host2.sub.example.com

Additional example to finely control IPv4 or IPv6 :
  # Example 01 : Global enable both IPv4 and IPv6, and update both records.
  usev4=webv4
  usev6=ifv6, ifv6=enp1s0

  protocol=porkbun
  apikey=APIKey
  secretapikey=SecretAPIKey
  root-domain=example.com
  host.example.com,host2.sub.example.com

  # Example 02 : Global enable only IPv4, and update only IPv6 record.
  usev4=webv4

  protocol=porkbun
  apikey=APIKey
  secretapikey=SecretAPIKey

o 'cloudns'

The 'cloudns' protocol is used for ClouDNS (https://www.cloudns.net).  Details
about dynamic DNS updates can be found at https://www.cloudns.net/dynamic-dns/.

Available configuration variables:
  * dynurl: The DynURL associated with the A or AAAA record you wish to update.

Limitations:
  * $program cannot tell if the DynURL you provide belongs to the hostname you
    specify.
  * ClouDNS does not document how to tell whether an update suceeded or failed,
    so there is no way for $program to reliably handle failures.
  * The ClouDNS API does not provide a reliable way to set the desired IP
    address. It might save the IP address you want, or it might save the IP
    address that connects to CloudDNS. It is more likely to work if you do not
    use a proxy.

Example ${program}.conf file entry:
  protocol=cloudns,                                                        \\

The 'gandi' protocol is used by the LiveDNS service offered by gandi.net.
Description of Gandi's LiveDNS API can be found at:

    https://api.gandi.net/docs/livedns/

Available configuration variables:
  * password: The Gandi API key or personal access token. If you don’t have
    one yet, you can generate a production API key from the API Key Page
    (in the Security section) or a personal access token from the Gandi
    Admin application. Required.
  * use-personal-access-token: Whether the password value is a API key or a
    personal access token. Defaults to API key. Note that API keys are
    deprecated by Gandi.
  * zone: The DNS zone to be updated. Required.
  * ttl: The time-to-live value associated with the updated DNS record.
    Optional; uses Gandi's default (10800) if unset.

Example ${program}.conf file entries:
  ## Single host update using API key.
  protocol=gandi
  zone=example.com
  password=my-gandi-api-key

  ## Single host update using Personal access token

o 'digitalocean'

The 'digitalocean' protocol updates domains hosted by Digital Ocean (https://www.digitalocean.com/).

This protocol supports both IPv4 and IPv6. It will only update an existing record; it will not
create a new one. So, before using it, make sure there's already one (and at most one) of each
record type (A and/or AAAA) you plan to update present in your Digital Ocean zone.

This protocol implements the API documented here:
  https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/.

You can get your API token by following these instructions:
  https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/

Available configuration variables:
  * server (optional): API server. Defaults to 'api.digitalocean.com'.
  * zone (required): DNS zone under which the hostname falls.
  * password (required): API token from DigitalOcean Control Panel. See instructions linked above.

Example ${program}.conf file entries:
  protocol=digitalocean, \\
  zone=example.com,      \\
  password=api-token     \\
  example.com,sub.example.com

o 'emailonly'

The 'emailonly' protocol is a dummy protocol that will send status emails but
not actually issue any dynamic DNS updates. You can use this if you don\'t
have a DDNS host, but still want to get emails when your IP address changes.
For this to have an effect, you must set the 'mail' config option, have
sendmail properly configured on your machine, and specify at least one dummy
hostname.

Example ${program}.conf file entries:
  ## single host update
  mail=me\@example.com
  protocol=emailonly
  host.example.com
EoEXAMPLE
}

# Execute main() if this file is run as a script or run via PAR (https://metacpan.org/pod/PAR),
# otherwise do nothing. This "modulino" pattern makes it possible to import this file as a module
# and test its functions directly; there's no need for test-only command-line arguments or stdout
# parsing.
