provides guidelines to make the contribution process as smooth as
possible.

To contribute changes, please open a pull request against the
[ddclient GitHub project](https://github.com/ddclient/ddclient/pulls).

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all

## Style

  * Above all else, try to match the existing style surrounding your
    edits.
  * No trailing whitespace.
  * Use spaces, not tabs.
  * Indentation level is 4 spaces.
  * Use parentheses for Perl function invocations: `print($fh "foo")`
    not `print $fh "foo"`
  * When reasonable, break lines longer than 99 characters. Rationale:
    - Imposing a limit makes it practical to open many side-by-side
      files or terminals without worrying about horizontal scrolling.
    - 99 is used instead of 100 so that the +/- column added by
      unified diff does not cause wrapping in 100 column wide
      terminals.
  * Add spaces to vertically align adjacent lines of code when doing
    so improves readability.

The following [perltidy](https://metacpan.org/pod/perltidy) command is
not perfect but it can get you close to our preferred style:

```shell
perltidy -l=99 -conv -ci=4 -ola -ce -nbbc -kis -pt=2 -b ddclient
```

## Git Hygiene

  * Please keep your pull request commits rebased on top of master.
  * Please use `git rebase -i` to make your commits easy to review:
    - Put unrelated changes in separate commits
    - Squash your fixup commits
  * Write your commit message in imperative mood, and explain *why*
    the change is made (unless obvious) in addition to *what* is
    changed.

If you are not very comfortable with Git, we encourage you to read
[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book) by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub
(freely available online).

## Unit tests

Always add tests for your changes when feasible.

To run the ddclient test suite:

  1. Install GNU Autoconf and Automake
  2. Run: `./autogen && ./configure && make VERBOSE=1 check`

To add a new test script:

  1. Create a new `t/*.pl` file with contents like this:

     ```perl
     use Test::More;
     # Your test dependencies go here.

     SKIP: { eval { require Test::Warnings; } or skip($@, 1); }
     eval { require 'ddclient'; } or BAIL_OUT($@);

     # Your tests go here.

     done_testing();
     ```

     See the documentation for
     [Test::More](https://perldoc.perl.org/Test/More.html) for
     details.

  2. Add your script to the `handwritten_tests` variable in
     `Makefile.am`.

  3. If your test script requires 3rd party modules, add the modules
     to the list of test modules in `configure.ac` and re-run
     `./autogen && ./configure`. Be sure to skip the tests if the
     module is not available. For example:

     ```perl
     eval { require Foo::Bar; } or plan(skip_all => $@);
     ```

## Compatibility

We strive to make ddclient usable on a wide variety of platforms.
Please limit yourself to Perl language features and modules available
on the following platforms:

  * Debian oldstable and newer
  * Ubuntu, [all maintained
    releases](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)
  * Fedora, [all maintained
    releases](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Release_Life_Cycle)
  * CentOS, [all maintained
    releases](https://wiki.centos.org/About/Product)
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux, [all maintained
    releases](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/)

See https://pkgs.org for available modules and versions.

Exceptions:
  * You may depend on modern language features or modules for new
    functionality when no feasible alternative exists, as long as the
    new dependency does not break existing functionality on old
    plaforms.
  * Test scripts may depend on arbitrary modules as long as the tests
    are skipped if the modules are not available. Effort should be
    taken to only use modules that are broadly available.

All shell scripts should conform with [POSIX Issue 7 (2018
edition)](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/) or later.

## Prefer Revert and Redo, Not Fix

Suppose a recent change broke something or otherwise needs
refinement. It is tempting to simply push a fix, but it is usually
better to revert the original change then redo it:

  * There is less subjectivity with a revert, so you are more likely
    to get a quick approval and merge. You can quickly "stop the
    bleeding" while you and the project maintainers debate about the
    best way to fix the problem with the original commit.
  * It is easier and less mistake-prone to cherry-pick a single commit
    (the redo commit) than two commits (the original commit plus the
    required fix).
  * Someone using blame to review the history will see the redo
    commit, not the buggy original commit.

## For ddclient Project Maintainers

### Merging Pull Requests

To facilitate reviews and code archaeology, `master` should have a
semi-linear commit history like this:

```
*   f4e6e90 sandro.jaeckel@gmail.com 2020-05-31 07:29:51 +0200 (master)
|\          Merge pull request #142 from rhansen/config-line-format
| * 30180ed rhansen@rhansen.org 2020-05-30 13:09:38 -0400
|/          Expand comment documenting config line format
*   01a746c rhansen@rhansen.org 2020-05-30 23:47:54 -0400

...
```

See https://stackoverflow.com/a/15721436 for an explanation of the
benefits.

This semi-linear style is mostly useful for multi-commit pull
requests. For single-commit pull requests, GitHub's "Squash and merge"
and "Rebase and merge" options are fine, though this approach still
has value:

  * The merge commit's commit message can link to the pull request
    or contain other contextual information.
  * It's easier to see who merged the PR (just look at the merge
    commit author.)
  * You can easily see both the original author timestamp (when the
    change was made) and the merge timestamp (when it went live).

To achieve a history like the above, the pull request must be rebased
onto `master` before merging. Unfortunately, GitHub does not have a
one-click way to do this (the "Rebase and merge" option does a
fast-forward merge, which is not what we want). See
[isaacs/github#1143](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1143) and
[isaacs/github#1017](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1017). Until
GitHub adds that feature, it has to be done manually:

```shell
# Set this to the name of the GitHub user or project that owns the
# fork used for the pull request:
PR_USER=

# Set this to the name of the branch in the fork used for the pull
# request:
PR_BRANCH=

# The commands below assume that `origin` refers to the
# ddclient/ddclient repository
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ddclient/ddclient.git

# Add a remote for the fork used in the PR
git remote add "${PR_USER:?}" git@github.com:"${PR_USER:?}"/ddclient

# Fetch the latest commits for the PR and ddclient master
git remote update -p

# Switch to the pull request branch
git checkout -b "${PR_USER:?}-${PR_BRANCH:?}" "${PR_USER:?}/${PR_BRANCH:?}"

# Rebase the commits (optionally using -i to clean up history) onto
# the current ddclient master branch
git rebase origin/master

# Force update the contributor's fork. This will only work if the
# contributor has checked the "Allow edits by maintainers" box in the
# PR. If not, you will have to manually merge the rebased commits.
git push -f

# If the force push was successful, you can now go into the GitHub UI
# and merge using the "Create a merge request" option.
#
# If the force push failed because the contributor did not check
# "Allow edits by maintainers", or if you prefer to merge manually,
# continue with the next steps.

# Switch to the local master branch
git checkout master

# Make sure the local master branch is up to date
git merge --ff-only origin/master

# Merge in the rebased pull request branch **WITHOUT DOING A
# FAST-FORWARD MERGE**
git merge --no-ff "${PR_USER:?}-${PR_BRANCH:?}"

# Review the commits before pushing
git log --graph --oneline --decorate origin/master..

# Push to ddclient master
git push origin master
```
