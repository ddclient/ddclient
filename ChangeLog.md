# ChangeLog

This document describes notable changes. For details, see the [source code
repository history](https://github.com/ddclient/ddclient/commits/master).

## Not yet released

### New features

  * Added support for OVH DynHost.
  * Added support for ClouDNS.
  * Added support for dinahosting.
  * Added support for Gandi LiveDNS.
  * Added a build system to make it easier for distributions to package
    ddclient:
    ```
    ./autogen && ./configure && make && make VERBOSE=1 check && make install
    ```
  * The `freedns` protocol (for https://freedns.afraid.org) now supports IPv6
    addresses.
  * New `ssl_ca_dir` and `ssl_ca_file` options to specify the location of CA
    certificates.
  * New built-in IP discovery service shorthands:
      - `googledomains` from https://domains.google
      - `he` from https://he.net
      - `ip4only.me`, `ip6only.me` from http://whatismyv6.com
      - `ipify-ipv4` and `ipify-ipv6` from https://www.ipify.org
      - `myonlineportal` from https://myonlineportal.net
      - `noip-ipv4` and `noip-ipv6` from https://www.noip.com
      - `nsupdate.info-ipv4` and `nsupdate.info-ipv6` from
        https://www.nsupdate.info
      - `zoneedit` from https://www.zoneedit.com
  * New built-in shorthands for obtaining the IP address from the following
    devices ([thanks to Geoff Simmons](https://bugs.debian.org/589980)):
      - `alcatel-530`: Alcatel/Thomson SpeedTouch 530
      - `siemens-ss4200`: Siemens SpeedStream 4200
      - `thomson-st536v6`: Thomson SpeedTouch 536v6
      - `thomson-tg782`: Thomson/Technicolor TG782
  * Added option `-curl` to access network with system Curl command instead
    of the Perl built-in IO::Socket classes.
  * Added option `-{no}web-ssl-validate` and `-{no}fw-ssl-validate`to provide
    option to disable SSL certificate validation.  Note that these only apply for
    network access when obtaining an IP address with `use=web` or `use=fw`
    (any firewall).  Network access to Dynamic DNS servers to set or retrieve
    IP address will always require certificate validation.

### Bug fixes

  * If multiple hosts are defined and one fails, ddclient will no longer skip
    the remaining hosts.
  * Minor `freedns` protocol fixes. In particular, you can now update an
    address that differs from the system's own.
  * Fixed a regression introduced in v3.9.0 that caused
    `use=ip,ip=<ipv4-address>` to fail.
  * "true" is now accepted as a boolean value.
  * The `ssl` option now applies to the `web` URL.

### Compatibility and dependency changes

  * Perl v5.10.1 or later is now required.
  * Removed dependency on Data::Validate::IP.
  * When `use=if`, iproute2's `ip` command is now attempted before falling back
    to `ifconfig` (it used to be the other way around). If you set `if-skip`,
    please check that your configuration still works as expected.
  * Removed the `concont` protocol. If you still use this protocol, please
    [file a bug report](https://github.com/ddclient/ddclient/issues) and we
    will restore it.
  * The `force` option no longer prevents daemonization.
  * If installed as `ddclientd` (or any other name ending in `d`), the default
    value for the `daemon` option is now 5 minutes instead of the previous 1
    minute.
  * The `pid` option is now ignored when ddclient is not daemonized.
  * ddclient now gracefully exits when interrupted by Ctrl-C.
  * The way ddclient chooses the default for the `use` option has changed.
    Rather than rely on the default, users should explicitly set the `use`
    option.
  * The `fw-banlocal` option is deprecated and no longer does anything.
  * The `if-skip` option is deprecated and no longer does anything.
  * The default server for the `dslreports1` protocol changed from
    `members.dyndns.org` to `www.dslreports.com`.
  * Removed support for defunct dtdns service
  * Removed support for defunct Hammernode service

## 2020-01-08 v3.9.1

  * added support for Yandex.Mail for Domain DNS service
  * added support for NearlyFreeSpeech.net
  * added support for DNS Made Easy
  * added systemd instructions
  * added support for dondominio.com
  * updated perl instruction
  * updated fritzbox instructions
  * fixed multidomain support for namecheap
  * fixed support for Yandex

## 2018-08-09 v3.9.0

  * new dependency: Data::Validate::IP
  * added IPv6 support for cloudfare
  * added suppport for freemyip
  * added configurable TTL to Cloudflare
  * added support for woima.fi dyndns service

### Detailed list of changes

  * [r208] wimpunk: ddclient: cosmetic, remove stray space indent
  * [r207] wimpunk: ddclient: Support IPv6 for CloudFlare
  * [r206] wimpunk: ddclient: name cheap support https now

    From name cheap it seems http is supported now.  Since the password was
    send on plaintext, https should be used
  * [r205] wimpunk: ddclient: Use JSON::PP instead of the (deprecated)
    JSON::Any
  * [r204] wimpunk: ddclient: Follow expected behavior

    Align ddclient behavior and documentation with namecheap's -
    https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/583/11/how-do-i-configure-ddclient
  * [r203] wimpunk: ddclient: Specify port number properly to 'nsupdate' (#58)

    If a port number is included in the 'server' configuration item, ddclient
    allows a port number to be specified by appending a colon and the port
    number to the server's name or IPv4 address.  However, nsupdate does not
    support this syntax, it requires the port number to be separated from the
    server name/address by whitespace.

    Signed-off-by: Kevin P. Fleming <kevin@km6g.us>
  * [r202] wimpunk: README.md, README.ssl, ddclient, sample-etc_ddclient.conf,
    sample-etc_rc.d_init.d_ddclient.alpine: Adding support for freemyip.com

    Support provided by @Cadence-GitHub in by pull request #47
  * [r195] wimpunk: ddclient, sample-etc_ddclient.conf: Merge pull request #25
    from dancapper/master

    Adding configurable TTL to Cloudflare

    This change adds configurable TTL to cloudflare instead of just using
    hardcoded value of 1 which sets "automatic" TTL any time ddclient updates
    the IP address.
  * [r194] wimpunk: sample-etc_ddclient.conf: Merge pull request #24 from
    gkranis/master

    Adding duckdns example

    Duckdns example added to sample-etc_ddclient.conf
  * [r193] wimpunk: README.md, sample-etc_rc.d_init.d_ddclient.ubuntu: Prevent
    service to start multiple times.  Added messages if trying to start/stop
    already started/stopped service.  Added daemon install instructions for
    ubuntu.
  * [r192] wimpunk: ddclient: odd-fw-patch-squashed
  * [r191] wimpunk: README.md, ddclient: Added support for woima.fi dyndns
    service
  * [r190] wimpunk: ddclient: Cleanup: removing revision info.

    Removing revision info even when it's just in the comments.

    old ChangeLog again.
  * [r188] wimpunk: .cvsignore, .gitignore: Cleanup: removing old ignore files

    Switching to git so we don't need .cvsignore anymore
  * [r187] wimpunk: COPYING: FSF address

    Address for FSF was wrong, corrected
  * [r186] wimpunk: Changelog.old, README.cisco, ddclient,
    sample-etc_cron.d_ddclient, sample-etc_ddclient.conf,
    sample-etc_dhclient-exit-hooks, sample-etc_dhcpc_dhcpcd-eth0.exe,
    sample-etc_ppp_ip-up.local, sample-etc_rc.d_init.d_ddclient.lsb,
    sample-etc_rc.d_init.d_ddclient.redhat: Cleanup: removing Id tags from the
    files

    Preparing a complete move to git. The Id tag isn't useful so removing from
    the files seemed to be the best solotion

## 2015-05-28 v3.8.3

  * added Alpine Linux init script - patch sent by @Tal on github.
  * added support for nsupdate - patch sent by @droe on github
  * allow log username-password combinations - patch sent by @dirdi on github

    ddclient back usable on CentOS and RHEL.
  * [r181] wimpunk: ddclient: ddclient: made json optional

    As suggested in pull 7 on github by @abelbeck and @Bugsbane it is better to

    Patch gently provided through github on
    https://github.com/wimpunk/ddclient/pull/13
  * [r170] wimpunk: README.md, ddclient, sample-etc_ddclient.conf: Added
    support for Cloudflare and multi domain support for namecheap

    Pull request #7 from @roberthawdon See
    https://github.com/wimpunk/ddclient/pull/7 for more info.
  * [r169] wimpunk: ddclient: Bugfix: allowing long username-password

    Patch provided by @dirdi through github.

    Patch provided by Stephen Couchman through github
  * [r164] wimpunk: ddclient: Only delete A RR, not any RR for the FQDN

    Make the delete command specific to A RRs. This prevents ddclient from
    deleting other RRs unrelated to the dynamic address, but on the same
    FQDN. This can be specifically a problem with KEY RRs when using SIG(0)
    instead of symmetric keys.

    Reported by: Wellie Chao Bug report:

    Fixes #71

  * optionally (-force) force an update, even if it may be unnecessary.

    This can be used to prevent dyndns.org from deleting a host that has not
    required an update for a long period of time.
  * optionally (-refresh), reissue all host updates.

    This can be used together with cron to periodically update DynDNS.  See
    sample-etc-cron.d-ddclient for details.
  * optionally (-retry) save failed updates for future processing.

    This feature can be used to reissue updates that may have failed due to
    network connectivity problems or a DynDNS server outage
