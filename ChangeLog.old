  This can be used together with cron to periodically update DynDNS. 
  See sample-etc-cron.d-ddclient for details.

- optionally (-retry) save failed updates for future processing.

  This feature can be used to reissue updates that may have failed due to
  network connectivity problems or a DynDNS server outage
